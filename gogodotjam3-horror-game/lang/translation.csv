note.dev_note.body,"Thank you so much for playing! This floor and the floors below are currently unfinished. This game was created for the GoGodotJam 3. This version you are playing is the ""jam version"" which is able to be ranked because it was completed in the time limit of the jam. I plan to release a ""post-jam"" version after the ranking period has completed. That version will include the lore, puzzles, etc... for this floor and deeper. I really hope you enjoyed this game. I'd really appreciate any feedback on it! Also keep watching the project page for that ""post jam"" release! XOXOXO – QueenOfSquiggles"
note.kitchen.title,Kitchen Note
note.kitchen.line0,"It's so frustrating being such a low class disciple! The Lamb (blessed be) requires that we cook and serve all meals for the entirety of the sanctity. Luckily, The Lamb (blessed be) does not come up here and won't find us lacking in faith."
note.matt.title,Matthew's Diary
note.matt.body,"Dear Diary, I do miss home. The Lamb (blessed be) has taken us here under his most holy patronage and has sealed us down here. Several children were also brought here to ""continue the Sacrement"" as The Lamb (blessed be) proclaimed. The Enemy has been following us. I do hope The Lamb (blessed be) can protect us from The Enemy. Maybe if my faith was stronger, I wouldn't have such worries? Signed, The cowardly, faithless Matthew"
note.jakob.title,Jakob's Note
note.jakob.body,"Since The Ascension, the energy among our sanctity has grown dark. The faithful still believe and the faithless are wracked with fear and anxiety. I am unsure. The Lamb (Blessed Be His Name Most Holy!) has taken care of us for so long. We have survived under His blessed care and have lived safe from the temptations of The Enemy for so long. Without the sun to guide us, it is difficult to tell time, but the faithless on the radio speak of years. We heard the faithless tell that we have been hiding well over a decade now. The Ascension was achieved, yet The Lamb still remains here. I am unsure what to believe? Have I fallen astray? Or could we have placed our faith in an agent of The Enemy? I will have to take comfort in the love of my dearest Dustin. He is always able to fill me with peace and serenity when the world seems so uncertain. His thick, corded muscles hold me so tight that I cannot help my melt into his loving arms. I hope we both can grow old together. My dearest, if you ever read this, I love you, and I will always care for you. Even if only one of us is able to Ascend, we can continue performing our own Sacrement as much as you like ;)"
note.abby.title,Abby's Journal
note.abby.body,"BLESSED BE MOST HOLY! The Lamb (Blessed Be) has granted me the most respectable rank of ""Divine Scribe"". I am to be to The Lamb (Blessed Be) what the gospels were to jesus (the lesser savior). Despite my weakness of faith The Glorious Lamb (Blessed Be) has taken pity on my shriveled soul! Perhaps though this divine command of our most sacred Lamb (Blessed Be) I will grow in my faith and become worthy of ""The Sacrement"". Signed, Abby Divine Scribe"
note.bathroom.title,Dirty Note
note.bathroom.body,"OMG Why is this the bathroom??? There's no showers There's no stalls just three fucking toilets and all the world to see!?!? It's the only one too? We ALL have to share and if one gets clogged, that's it. The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy) has His own bathroom private from the rest of us. Why do we all have to share?"
note.dustin.title,Dustin's Journal
note.dustin.body,"MY DEAREST IF YOU ARE READING THIS ABSOLUTELY DO NOT!!! IT IS NOT FOR YOU SO PLEASE DO NOT READ!!! Dearest Journal, I'm torn. The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy), has blessed me with a higher rank than my beloved. I am able to live even closer to His love. Yet my dearest remains with weaker faith. I do wish to continue loving him until the day I die, but I fear that his weak faith my tarnish mine. What if I am rejected from Ascension due to loving one who is not He, the most venerable precious Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy). What if these desires of the flesh are what cause me to worry so. The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy) promises that all who have faith will have no fear. Does that mean my faith is weak? Am I truely worthy of the love of the flesh, let alone the blessed love of The Sacrement? Am I even worthy of either? I am a sinful, rejected maggot. Why would The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy) ever allow me to ascend as He has? My soul is tainted by the desires of the physical world. I could never be"
note.jessica.title,Jessica's Note
note.jessica.body,"OMG! Abby is such a freak! I thought that she was a goody little angel like the rest of this fucked up cult, but she is definitly not the ""christian"" type. She is so desperate to please ""The Lamb"" or whatever, but really? Whenever she gets too troubled she comes right to me. I tell her that the Lamb loves her and then she relaxes and we can talk about real stuff. She even tells me that I have such a strong faith because of how little I worry. I'm not worried because I see right through that little shit. He wants to be a little savior and make a bunch of people devote their lives to him. He takes people into his room in ""The Sanctuary"" (LOL) and performs ""The Sacrement"" (whatever that is!) and then goes about his day pretending to be fucking saint-like. I'm just biding my time waiting out here for something to go down. I know he's got children down here and if he so much as thinks about hurting them, I'm going to use my handcuffs to chain him to his own sacred bed and get them the hell out of here. I know he says that he sealed us in to protect us from ""The Enemy"", but really I think the FBI was hot on his tail and he got scared. I could probably pile up a bunch of random boxes and clamber up out the vent we had to crawl though. Then these kiddos could get a proper life outside. He keeps saying that he is close to ascending, so if he disappears after that, I might just take the kids out then. I don't expect the cult to last longer than he does."
note.dustin_exercise.title,Dustin's Note
note.dustin_exercise.body,"The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy) has given us a room to perform exercise to keep our bodies fresh. We are to reject bodily desires but we also must protect the temple which guards our souls. We have to keep our temple strong and that means ensuring our strength and health. The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy) is able to guard His soul through faith alone, but we are weak. We require strength of body, mind, and soul! Exercise, resistence to worldly temptations, and The Sacrement fulfill all of our needs. "
note.abby_radio.title,Divine Scribe's Reflection
note.abby_radio.body,"The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy) has blessed us with a radio. He (Blessed Be Most Holy) has commanded that we should listen to the radio programs to understand what the faithless are up to. He (Blessed Be Most Holy) wants us to inform Him (Blessed Be Most Holy) of any information regarding our most holy sanctity. We are to practice guarding ourselves from the evils of the faithless by listening to their programs, temptations, and their music. After every session I feel stronger in my faith. He (Blessed Be Most Holy) will protect us from The Enemy and his agents. As long as we keep our faith strong, the faithless cannot hurt us. Signed, Abby Divine Scribe of The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy)"

He (Blessed Be Most Holy) will take great care to ensure your health and happiness, which is why he has these little requests for you. I trust you will remember without needing a reminder. XOXO"
note.story.title,Story Book
note.story.body,"Long long ago, in a land far far away; where there were no walls and everything was bright. There grew an evil worse than anyone had ever seen. A very smart and strong and faithful man was guided. He (Blessed Be Most Holy) was to be our messiah, like Jesus before Him (Blessed Be Most Holy). He gathered his chosen few and took them into the safety of this sanctity. Even as he was sealing the doorways to our blessed sanctity, the evil was searching for us. It wanted to destroy our faith, and our Messiah (Blessed Be Most Holy). Guided by The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy), we were able to evade the great evil and hide away. And here we will remain until the evil is gone from this world. The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy), who knows all things, will guide us and care for us. In our gratitude we serve and offer ourselves to The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy). Remember this story children, as some of you were not quite wise enough to remember the times we lived in the world of evil. Take care of this holy sanctity and perform the rituals as appropriate to your age, and care for the younger children. The Lamb (Blessed Be Most Holy) will love and cherish you, and grant you your reward for your faithfullness."
note.nighttime_prayer.title,Night-Time Prayer
note.nighttime_prayer.body,"Blessed Lamb Most Holy, watch over me as I sleep. Tend to my dreams as a cook tends to a broth. Strengthen my heart and nurture my faith. May I always love you, as you have loved me. May I grow old enough to strengthen my faith through The Sacrement as our elders do. In the Name of The Lamb, Most Blessed and Holy, I pray. Amen"
